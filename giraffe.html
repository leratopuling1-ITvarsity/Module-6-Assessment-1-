                  <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
              <p>Giraffes were depicted in art throughout the African continent, including that of the Kiffians, Egyptians, and Kushites.[117]: 45–47  The Kiffians were responsible for a life-size rock engraving of two giraffes, dated 8,000 years ago, that has been called the "world's largest rock art petroglyph".[117]: 45 [118] How the giraffe got its height has been the subject of various African folktales.[14] The Tugen people of modern Kenya used the giraffe to depict their god Mda.[119] The Egyptians gave the giraffe its own hieroglyph, named 'sr' in Old Egyptian and 'mmy' in later periods.[117]: 49 </p>
                  <p>Where are Giraffes found?</p>
              <p>Most giraffes live in grasslands and open woodlands in East Africa, especially in reserves such as the Serengeti National Park and the Amboseli National Park. Some are also found in the reserves of Southern Africa</p>
